# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

**PDFDRILL** is the merge of two predecessor projects into one toolchain whose
purpose is **quality control of PDF→LaTeX OCR**, building toward a
reinforcement / self-learning loop that optimizes the extraction toolchain.

It combines:

1. **`src/pdfdrill/`** — the low-level PDF drill-down toolkit (from *CSPIRY*).
   A flat CLI that returns prose, persists state in a sidecar next to each PDF,
   and wraps the heavy tools (poppler, pdfplumber, pix2tex). This is the entry
   point the Claude.ai web chatbot drives directly, exposed as the `pdfdrill`
   SKILL.
2. **`src/docmodel/`** — the **unified document-object model** (the extended
   *CSPIRZ* `docobject`). A typed `Document` of `DocObject`s with anchor-based
   `Stream`s, `Realization`s across streams, and `Alignment`s between them.
   MathPix `lines.json` is the only known format that lets us compare a LaTeX
   expression against the CDN image MathPix actually rendered — so this model
   is the home of that comparison. Each `Equation`/`Formula` carries `latex`,
   `refnum`, and `cdn_url`.
3. **`src/docops/`** — the operator pipeline over a `Document`: `Mutator`s
   (modify in place) and `Projector`s (emit artifacts — plaintext, LLM-compact
   markdown, TiddlyWiki tiddlers, and the comparison table).

> **Naming:** the unified model package is `docmodel` (renamed from the
> predecessor `docobject`). The on-disk model artifact is still suffixed
> `.docmodel.json`.

## Running

Everything runs in **Python 3** (no Bun/TypeScript on the live path — this was
the accessibility requirement for the Claude.ai web chatbot). Packages live
under `src/`, so the import root is `src`:

```bash
# convenience wrapper (sets PYTHONPATH=src for you)
./pdfdrill size  paper.pdf
./pdfdrill urls  paper.pdf

# or explicitly
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pdfdrill <command> <pdf> [args]
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m docmodel.main --bib KEY --lines X.lines.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m docops.main   --in KEY.docmodel.json --out-dir ./out
```

The pdfdrill commands (`size`, `pdfinfo`, `urls`, `dests`, `fonts`,
`fonts_layer`, `images`, `pix2tex`, `abstract`, `toc`, `md`, `page`, `fetch`,
`plan`, `drill`, `status`, `tsv`, `render`) are documented in
`.claude/skills/pdfdrill/SKILL.md`. Each returns prose, not JSON.

### Killer case worth remembering

`pdfdrill urls` reads the PDF **annotation layer** (via `pdfinfo`), so it
surfaces hyperlinks that have **no visible anchor text** and therefore never
appear in any rendered-text stream an LLM reads. On the NeurIPS submission
`2605.12061`, the paper's anonymized source-code release
(`https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Unified-Representation-A9D9/`) is a page-1
link annotation with `'(no visible text)'` — invisible to plain text
extraction, instant at level 1. Always run the cheap level 0–1 commands
(`size`, `pdfinfo`, `urls`, `dests`) before assuming the rendered text is all
there is.

## Tests

```bash
python3 tests/test_basic.py    #  7 tests — docmodel converter
python3 tests/test_docops.py   # 14 tests — docops operators
```

Both are self-contained (they add `src/` to `sys.path`).

## Architecture notes (docmodel)

- **Anchors are opaque identities, not positions.** Inserts/deletes in one
  stream don't invalidate references elsewhere.
- **Source streams are immutable.** Modules *add* objects/realizations/
  alignments; the raw MathPix payload stays recoverable verbatim.
- **Objects are stream-independent.** A `MathExpression` exists once with
  semantic props; its realizations live in whichever streams it surfaces in.
  The `cdn` realization role holds a rendered-image URL with no anchor range.
- Converter modules (`docmodel/modules/`) load from `config.json`
  (`"type": "application/python"`, ordered by `procOrder`). Operators in the
  same config are tagged `"op": "mutator"` / `"op": "projector"`; each loader
  ignores entries it doesn't own.

## Roadmap (decomposed — each phase gets its own spec + plan)

- **Phase 1 — Unified model + capture** *(in progress)*: extend `docmodel`
  with a `Region` type and `provenance`/`score` on `Realization`; add a Python
  `pdfdrill mathpix` command (port of the old `mtestzx.ts` upload/poll/download
  flow, creds from `MATHPIX_APP_ID`/`MATHPIX_APP_KEY` env vars); ingest MathPix
  `lines.json` and pdfdrill's own extraction (pdfplumber chars, detected-math
  LaTeX, pix2tex) as competing provenances region-matched to each equation;
  emit the **three-way comparison HTML table** (LaTeX | KaTeX render | MathPix
  CDN image) as a `docops` projector.
- **Phase 2 — Scoring layer**: per-expression quality metrics turning the
  comparison into numbers (`Realization.score`).
- **Phase 3 — Optimization / self-learning loop**: use Phase-2 scores to tune
  detection heuristics / `latex_map` / OCR-engine choice.

## Credentials

MathPix `app_id`/`app_key` must come from environment variables and must never
be committed. The predecessor `mtestzx.ts` hardcoded them; that file is
git-ignored and is **not** part of this repo.

## Current status

Merged layout + working pdfdrill CLI (verified on `2605.12061`) + passing
suites. The MathPix-only QC path is **end-to-end functional**:

- **`pdfdrill mathpix <pdf>`** — Python port of `mtestzx.ts`, idempotent,
  creds from env or git-ignored `mathpix_creds.py` (`tests/test_mathpix.py`).
- **`pdfdrill model <pdf>`** — builds the unified docmodel `Document` from
  `lines.json` (auto-chains `mathpix`), writes `<pdf>.drill/model.docmodel.json`.
- **`pdfdrill compare <pdf>`** — `ComparisonHtmlProjector` emits
  `<pdf>.drill/compare.html`: per equation, LaTeX | KaTeX render | MathPix CDN
  image (`tests/test_compare.py`). Verified on `2605.12061`: 239 equations.

Test totals: `test_basic` 7, `test_docops` 14, `test_mathpix` 5,
`test_compare` 3.

Competing-provenance OCR for equation crops:

- **`pdfdrill.mathpix_snip`** — small tool over MathPix `POST /v3/text` (Snip).
  Accepts a local image, a `data:` URI, or an image URL (so it can point at a
  self-constructed `cdn.mathpix.com` crop). Returns `latex_styled` / `data[]`
  LaTeX plus per-line `confidence` (a ready-made score signal).
  `python -m pdfdrill.mathpix_snip <image|url>`; tests in `tests/test_snip.py`.
- **`pix2tex` is intentionally NOT used** in the comparison pipeline (PyTorch
  dependency, untested in the claude.ai web sandbox). The other competing
  provenance is the LLM itself, prompted on an equation crop.

The "competing tools" substrate is in place:

- **`docmodel.core.Region`** (MathPix-native rectangle: `top_left_x/y`,
  `width`, `height`, `space`) + **`provenance`/`score`/`region` on
  `Realization`** (round-tripped; unset fields omitted from JSON). See
  `tests/test_model_ext.py`.
- **`pdfdrill snip <pdf> [--limit N] [--force]`** — OCRs each equation's CDN
  crop via MathPix Snip and attaches a `provenance="snip"` `latex_candidate`
  realization (LaTeX + `confidence` → `score`) to the model.
- **`ComparisonHtmlProjector`** now renders one LaTeX+KaTeX column pair per
  competing provenance (MathPix baseline first, then snip/llm), with the
  candidate confidence shown inline. Verified live on `2605.12061`: 12 crops
  snipped (mean confidence 0.90), Snip column present in `compare.html`.

Still to do: the **LLM provenance** (prompt-on-crop → `latex_candidate`,
provenance `llm`), optionally rendering our own crop from the PDF page
(independent of MathPix), then Phase 2 (scoring across provenances, using snip
`confidence` and image agreement) and Phase 3 (self-learning loop).
